Hi,
This Python application securely accesses encrypted data using a verified USB device. When the correct USB is connected, it opens a UI for password input, 
then passes the password to a script for de-obfuscation and decryption. The decrypted data is automatically entered through simulated keyboard inputs, ensuring efficient and secure access.
This code requeries you to edit the file "password_algo.py" to input your own encryption algorithm and set up your own key for that algorithm.
Check out the "USB Password.png" file on how this application works.
